# Introduction

The objective of this Readme file is to explain explicitly how did we reached to the final solution, talking about how it was decided the design and development decisions of this practical work II. The project has been done with C sharp and with the extension of MAUI.


# Description 

The purpose of this practical work II was to develop a calculator. The user to make the calculations, it had to create a profile. In each of the profiles, the calculations made by the user were stored in a json. The calculator has been made knowing about the importance of data protection. The user for creating the profile has to accept the data privacy. The password of this calculator has been made so that the user has to put a minimum of characters, words or special characters, to be sure that the password is secure. After creating a profile, the calculator goes to the next page, with all of the possible calculations needed, the user types in a number and selects the change he or she wants. The calculator is made that if the number typed in is not admited for example in binary or hexadecimal, the calculator displays a message.




# Problems 

After finishing the practical work II, I can say that I have encoutared lots of problems when doing the project. One of most common problems that I had constantly is the interaction between pages, or when something was clicked how to change the page.The GUI was for me the most difficult part, as lots of the times the things did unexpected things and solving that was a hard task

The biggest problem that I had, was storing the data in the json. First, when the json was created, the format was not as expected, and there could be future problems when reading it, so I went back and figure out what was missing.The real problem was when the user already created the profile, that was included in the json, but the operations that I was making no. I spent a lot of time to figure out how to do it.


# Conclusions

With this practical work 2 I learned how does one page connect to the other. Creating this calculator has made me think how does data is also stored and the GUI makes it seen very simple, but behind all of the buttons and labels, there is lots of programming behind that makes it easy fot the user.

I think that this project was hard, because not only we had to program, we had to create an interface, and it was very difficult for me to connect everything and it in certain moments in was very frustating. In the end I am happy of the work done but it was not easy.
